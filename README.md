## About
A project for frontend application observability, Grafana Faro includes a highly configurable web SDK for real user monitoring (RUM) that instruments browser frontend applications to capture observability signals. The frontend telemetry can then be correlated with backend and infrastructure data for seamless, full-stack observability.
